## Toys & Tools
Every software goes here.

### Shell
Making your `SHELL`ter nice and cosy
- [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) - (tl;dr: help pages) `man` made better with emphasis on every day tasks
- [nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn) - terminal file manager with shortcuts for every action and 4 tabs in one session (plugins included)
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) - like `cat` but with colors, paging and git integration (extra points for showing non-printable chars by symbols: BS, LF etc.)
- [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) - like `ls` but with colors and better structure
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - probably the fastest `grep` replacement

### Data
Wave a `DATA` wand
- [VisiData](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata) - TUI for exploring and arranging large amounts of tabular data (you can even make a table from scratch with it)
- [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) - CLI for JSON processing with a lot of filtering options
- [yq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) - CLI for YAML processing (based on [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq), JSON partially supported)

### Vim
`VIM` vim promovet insitam<sup>*</sup>

#### Plugins
